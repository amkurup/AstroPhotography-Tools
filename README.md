## üåô City Imaging Optimization

Both tools are engineered for success under Bortle 9 light pollution:

### Target Selection Strategy
- **Emission Nebula Priority**: H-alpha rich objects that work with narrowband filters
- **Surface Brightness Aware**: Avoids low-contrast targets that disappear in skyglow
- **Moon Phase Intelligence**: Automatic recommendations based on lunar illumination
- **Altitude Optimization**: Real-time calculations for atmospheric penetration

### Processing Excellence
- **Narrowband Workflows**: Specialized techniques for dual-band filter data
- **Advanced Background Extraction**: Aggressive light pollution removal methods
- **City-Specific Calibration**: Color balance techniques that work despite skyglow
- **Noise Management**: Specialized denoising for high-ISO city conditions

## üöÄ Equipment Compatibility

### Universal Telescope Support
- **Focal Length Range**: 200mm to 5000mm (wide-field to planetary imaging)
- **Optical Systems**: Refractors, reflectors, SCTs, and telephoto lenses
- **Camera Types**: APS-C, Full Frame, Micro 4/3, dedicated astronomy cameras
- **Filter Integration**: Optimized for L-eXtreme, DuoNarrowBand, and broadband

### City Imaging Best Practices
- **Filter Strategy**: Narrowband filters cut through light pollution effectively
